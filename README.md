# Face-Recognition-system
This is a computer vision project that utilizes face recognition technology to identify and log individuals in a live video stream. The system is capable of detecting and recognizing faces in real-time, comparing them with a pre-trained dataset of known faces, and logging the recognized individuals along with the date and time of the detection.
